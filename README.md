# Three-Month-Calendar

This application is handy for any job where you need ready access to a calendar showing last month, the current month, and next month. For example, when balancing a checkbook or online banking account. You may need to pay charges from the previous statement, and need to know when that cut-off date is. At the same time, you might want to plan your next bill payments, and see how future dates fall.
