# Three-Month-Calendar

This application for Microsoft Windows is handy for any job where you need ready access to a calendar showing last month, the current month, and next month. For example, when balancing a checkbook or online banking account. You may need to pay charges from the previous statement and want to know when that cut-off date was. At the same time, you might need to plan your next bill payments, and want to see where future dates fall.

This application lets you see all relevant calendar dates in one view.
